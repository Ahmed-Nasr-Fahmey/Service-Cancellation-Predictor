# Service Cancellation Predictor

The Service Cancellation Predictor is a compact demonstration of a predictive model designed to forecast service cancellations in a simplified context. This project showcases the basic functionalities and concepts of a service cancellation prediction system, using a straightforward dataset and a simplified prediction approach.

## Key Components and Features

- **Dataset Selection**: Choose a small dataset containing historical service records and relevant factors that could influence cancellations. This dataset could include attributes like date, time, weather conditions, and customer behavior.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, normalize data, and format the inputs in a way that can be fed into a prediction model.

- **Feature Selection**: Select a subset of influential features from the dataset that are most likely to impact service cancellations. These could include factors like time of day, day of the week, and basic weather indicators.

- **Model Selection**: Choose a simple machine learning model for prediction, such as a logistic regression classifier or a decision tree classifier. Train the model using historical data and the selected features.

- **Prediction Logic**: Develop the prediction logic using the trained model. Given input features (e.g., time, day, weather), the model will output a probability score indicating the likelihood of a cancellation.

- **Testing and Validation**: Test the prototype using sample inputs and validate its predictions against the original dataset. Evaluate its accuracy and discuss any observed deviations.

## Benefits and Learning Objectives

- Gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing, feature selection, and basic machine learning model implementation.

- Understand the process of translating data into insights and predictions.

- Familiarize yourself with creating a basic user interface for interaction.

- Learn the importance of setting alert thresholds to facilitate decision-making.

This small-scale Service Cancellation Predictor project serves as a valuable learning exercise, providing a foundation for understanding the core concepts of predictive modeling and its potential applications in real-world scenarios.
